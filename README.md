Capital One Predictive Modeling Project
This repository contains my submission for a take-home assignment used in the recruitment process for data science positions at Capital One. The objective was to build a predictive model using synthetic datasets to estimate withheld target values from the test set.

Project Overview
The project involves building machine learning models to predict the target variable with high accuracy. The evaluation metric for the model's performance is Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Approach and Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values to ensure a complete dataset.
Encoded categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models.
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler for consistent model performance.
2. Feature Engineering
Identified key features that influenced the target variable.
Applied feature transformations to improve predictive accuracy.
3. Modeling
Linear Regression: Used as a baseline model for its simplicity and ease of interpretation.
Random Forest Regressor: Employed to capture non-linear relationships in the data, leading to better performance.
4. Model Evaluation
Compared models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the validation set.
Generated predictions for the test dataset based on the best-performing model.
Deliverables
Prediction File: A 1,000 x 1 text file containing one prediction per line for the test dataset.
Writeup: A detailed report describing:
Data preprocessing steps.
Feature engineering techniques.
Model selection rationale.
Performance metrics and results.
Code Implementation:
Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
Reproducible notebooks to demonstrate the workflow.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Results
Achieved an MSE of [Your MSE] on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the applied models and techniques.
